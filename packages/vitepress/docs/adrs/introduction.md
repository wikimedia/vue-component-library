# Architecture Decision Records

An architecture decision record (ADR) aims to document an important software design decision by explaining the context and consequences of the decision.

The ADRs in this repo follow [this template](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/index.md).

For convenience a [template file](./NNNN-adr-template.md) is provided in this folder. When writing a new ADR copy the template and start from there.
