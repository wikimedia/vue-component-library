# Codex Tokens

This package holds the Codex design tokens and tools needed to build them.

## Package organization

The tokens are organized in two categories
* base
* aliases

Each category serves its own purpose:

Base tokens reflect the elementary visual foundations of the system. They are context agnostic (e.g. "accent-30"). Aliases are abstractions that communicate the intended context of use of a token. They mostly represent styles that are shared among several components (e.g. "border-color-progressive-active").

## Looking at the tokens

The tokens can be inspected by looking at the source files in the [`properties` folder](./properties) or the generated token files - in different output formats - in the [`dist` folder](./dist) (requires a build!).

## Demo

To do: visualize the tokens in the demo tool.
